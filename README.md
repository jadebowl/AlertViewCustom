</p>

## Installation

### CocoaPods

CustomAlertView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'CustomAlert'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate CustomAlert into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "jadebowl/CustomAlertView"
```

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to build the framework and drag the built `CustomAlert.xcframework` bundles from Carthage/Build into the "Frameworks and Libraries" section of your applicationâ€™s Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/jadebowl/CustomAlertView.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `CustomAlert`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate CustomAlert into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

Create an AlertView:
```ogdl
let alert = AlertView()
```

Customise the UI, add Fade transition and Constraints:
```ogdl
        alert.setupContents(accentColor: .purple, backgroundColor: .systemBackground, title: "I am a title", message: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.", agreeTitle: "Go to Settings", cancelTitle: "Cancel")
        view.addSubview(alert)
        alert.fadeIn(duration: 0.3)
        alert.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        alert.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
        alert.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
        alert.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
        alert.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
```

Manage Actions:
```ogdl
extension ViewController: AlertViewDelegate {
    func agreeAction() {
        // MARK: - Example: Go to Settings
        guard let settingsUrl = URL(string: UIApplication.openSettingsURLString) else { return }
        if UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(settingsUrl) {
            UIApplication.shared.open(settingsUrl, completionHandler: { (success) in
                print("Settings opened: \(success)")
            })
        }
    }
    
    func cancelAction() {
        alert.removeFromSuperView(duration: 0.3)
    }
}
```
